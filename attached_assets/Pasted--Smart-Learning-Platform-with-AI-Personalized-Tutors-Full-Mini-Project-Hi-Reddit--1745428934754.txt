Hi Reddit! 👋  
I'm currently working on my **Mini Project**: a complete **Smart Learning Platform** designed to change the way students learn online. Unlike traditional LMS platforms (like Coursera or Swayam), this system focuses on **personalization, adaptive content, and community-powered learning** — all driven by AI.

## 🎯 Objective of the Project

- **Personalized Learning Pathways**: Create adaptive study plans based on student progress, strengths, and weaknesses.
- **Story-Based Learning Engagement**: Deliver concepts through real-world stories and scenarios to make learning more fun and relatable.
- **Fun Quizzes & Motivation**: Embed gamified quizzes and progress boosters to keep students engaged.
- **Collaborative Learning Community**: Build a peer-to-peer support system where students learn together, ask questions, and grow as a team.

## 🧠 What Makes It Smart?

Upon login, every student goes through:

1. **Psychological Assessment Questions**  
   → Used to categorize students into:
   - 📚 Story-Based Learners  
   - 📘 Theory-Based Learners  
   - 🔧 Practical-Based Learners  

2. **Domain Selection**  
   → Students choose the subject/domain they want to master (e.g., Web Dev, AI, Cybersecurity, etc.).

3. **Personalized AI Tutor is Assigned**  
   → Based on learning style + domain:
   - Gives a **custom learning roadmap**
   - Suggests content formats (video, animation, text)
   - Offers **real-time support** with 2-way chat interaction

- ✅ View course progress
- ✅ Track strengths, weaknesses, and completion rates
- ✅ Get AI feedback and alternate content recommendations
- ✅ Set learning goals and see weekly achievements

## 🌐 Community-Based Learning System

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Students can ask questions in discussion forums.
